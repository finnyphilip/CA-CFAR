# ABSTRACT
SONAR detection is one of the most important process which is carried out by comparing
the received signal amplitude to a threshold value. Since there are so many disadvantages
with fixed threshold, here adaptive threshold is used, known as Constant False Alarm
Rate(CFAR).

A hardware architecture that implements a CA-CFAR and OS-CFAR
processor is presented here. The detection schemes presented has the following advantage:
The technique yields unbiased estimates under a non-homogeneous underwater
environment, because the false alarm rate is maintained at a constant level while the
threshold changes with different underwater environments, in presence of interfering
targets. Functional verification is done using Matlab, Simulation in Xilinx Vivado and the
architecture is implemented in FPGA.
